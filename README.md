# Today I Learned

I've kept a collection of TILs since I started writing Ruby in 2013. I'm creating a repository out of them now (2016), so that I might be more intentional about documenting the things I learn.

When a TIL predates this repository, I've indicated the original date in [YYYY-MM-DD] notation.
